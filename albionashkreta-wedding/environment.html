<b><i><p class="p8">While weddings have occasionally been accused of being wasteful in many ways, they absolutely don’t have to be. There are many different eco-friendly wedding choices you can make to reduce wedding waste or lessen the carbon footprint of your event.

Now obviously there’s no way you could do every single one of these things– there are many overlapping ideas here.

<b> <i><p class="p9">-The color, style and ceremonial importance of the gown can depend on the religion and culture of the wedding participants. In Western cultures and Anglo-Saxon cultural spheres, the wedding dress is most commonly white, a fashion made popular by Queen Victoria when she married in 1840.Weddings performed during and immediately following the Middle Ages were often more than just a union between two people. They could be a union between two families, two businesses or even two countries. Many weddings were more a matter of politics than love, particularly among the nobility. Brides were therefore expected to dress.</p></i></b>
